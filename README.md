# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: an `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero. The `MyClass.java` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to divide by zero. The `MyClassSolution.java` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential division by zero error.

## Bug Description
The original code directly divides by the variable `x`, which is initialized to 0. This causes an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown at runtime.
